## Why Redux Toolkit over Redux?

Redux patterns make states predictable, scalable, and easy to maintain due to the precise rule of how each unit in the redux flow should behave and work.

However Redux comes with a few challenges:

- A developer has to write too much code to configure a store
- Too much code makes it hard to understand and less clean
- Too many packages need to be installed
- Writing reducers become more complex in Redux

To overcome these challenges, the Redux team introduced Redux Toolkit which enables you write redux logic efficiently. Redux toolkit includes core redux packages with simple & clean redux code.

## Steps To Follow

1- Create a Redux Store

2- Provide the Redux Store to React Main App.js

3- Create a Redux State Slice

4- Add Slice Reducers to the Store

5- Use Redux State and Actions in React Component

6- To use redux state in other component use useSelector hook from react-redux.

7- First Step is to configure our Store, now this is where youâ€™ll see the magic of redux toolkit!
